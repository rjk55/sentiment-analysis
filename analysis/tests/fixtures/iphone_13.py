Not much exciting given Apple aren’t really changing things.My frustration is with the exchange service.I submitted an exchange for my old iPhone X and stated the screen was cracked and was informed unless any other issue I would receive £50.I sent the phone in, it was then returned saying I wouldn’t receive the £50 as the screen was cracked.I have no issue with the reason, however do have issue that I communicated it was cracked and bought the new phone on the basis of an exchange.I’m now unable to exchange the phone elsewhere so effectively have lost £50 due to the lack of commitment.I suggest customers should submit pictures for this service to then commit to an exchange rather than wasting my timeVery poor customer service!",

The screen is larger vs the phone size than my last iPhone (7) but this is due to the removal of the ‘thumb’ button.  I have to say I did prefer the fingerprint to the Face ID. And in the world of masks (which I still have to use at work) I don’t feel it’s as secure.  Battery life is much better, possibly just because it’s a new phone though.  Storage is also much better.  Other than that, if you’ve owned an iPhone it’s much the same.  If you’re an android person then you’ll probably hate it, else you’d have an iPhone already (and vice Versa!)",

This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!",

Befits you’d just reach across with your finger. To actually pick it up and look at the phone is nuts. Next. To operate the phone you are for ever trying to remember all the new slide combinations to access things that before were so easy to do. For instance Square crop on photos is no longer available unless you swipe up but only in a certain area. If I could I would throw this phone in the bin and go back to my 6s which was a far better phone. Don’t buy this phone. Apple are washed up. There era is over.",

The screen is so bright and colourful with excellent blacks. It films video in 4K Dolby Vision and is a must have phone for filming interviews or mini documentaries. Having two lenses is enough for me. I’ve blown the footage up and it has clarity as well as great audio, even in noisy environments. I work in media and can’t always carry a big camera around. This is great backup for those situations when my gear isn’t with me.I shot the attached photos in pitch black and was amazed at the results. Portrait photos are astonishing too. Just remember to keep the filter on normal (default). The others aren’t always reliable. You don’t need any post production either and the depth of field (background blur) is brilliant. At this rate there’ll be no need for cameras anymore in the future. Obviously a good camera is better right now, but the output of this iPhone is very usable.When watching movies, the image is sharp and vibrant with amazing sound. Watching movie trailers YouTube is such a different experience now. I can’t believe these tiny speakers are so loud and clear.At this price, there’s no better value and with the processor/gpu power, you can use photo and video editing software with ease. It’s just so powerful. I recommend it to everyone, especially with the crystal clear FaceTime front camera.",

I tried hardware resets many times, updates through iTunes over and over and factory resets many many times. In the end I have had to send the phone off to Apple to be repaired. I still think this is a good phone though. And online Apple support is really good. But I can't help feeling disappointed that this can happen.As an update, Apple fixed this very quickly.

The new iPhone 13 got great reviews for its camera, reasonable reviews for battery life and it’s not too big (almost the same as my S8) so I switched!I’ve had it for 3 months and I’m very happy with it. It’s easy to use,very responsive and the camera is great. I especially like that I can access the camera with a single left swipe from the Lock Screen. Battery life is good so far, I’m a light user, so I can get two days of use between charges. Hopefully that’ll continue.",

The camera is amazing and the cinematic mode is mindblowing and of course it’s has loads of amazing features etc but it didn’t take long to start hitting walls where apps were concerned. Stuff that was easy and free and sometimes standard features on my Samsung either didn’t exist or you had to pay for it. Also some usability is not as user friendly as Samsung. I often felt when I was using my Samsung it was like using a laptop. You could browse between pages seamlessly and minimise apps and move between them too. But apple still haven’t been able to manage that. Lots of other stuff like this too. I will probably keep for a year just because I have committed to it now and it might grow on me. However it’s likely I will go back to a Samsung when I can",

Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.EDIT: I’ve found a way to speed up dialling my main contacts. You can use shortcuts to build a speed dial menu which you can access via an icon on your Home Screen. Thank-you, YouTube!",

One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13).  Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer.  so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good.  I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics:  The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display:  The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery:  The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera:  The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.",

The phone itself is fast, wish that Apple had stuck with touch ID though as if I wear makeup or have hair down it often won’t recognise me.Packaged sympathetically to reduce plastic, no charger just the charging usb cable. The box was also well packaged and product was undamaged, carefully delivered by person to person.",
